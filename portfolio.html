    This section is where I'll be putting all the creative stuff I've worked on!
    My main interests are music (especially singing) and games (tabletop and video).
    I've also written some fiction and poems, and I'll probably put those up here eventually.
    If I ever start drawing or acting again, that might be here too.

    For now, I present only my MAGNUM OPUS:
